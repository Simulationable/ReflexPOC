# Summary

ReflexPOC is a modular reflex-oriented software framework designed to enable emotionally-aware non-player characters (NPCs) in games and interactive simulations. Traditional NPCs often rely on static behavior trees or prompt-chained dialogue, which fail to account for emotional volatility, crisis handling, and trust-based interaction modulation. ReflexPOC introduces a novel six-layer ecosystem architecture that explicitly separates reactive logic, safety filtering, token override conditions, and recovery mechanisms from the language model itself.

The architecture is implemented in C# using ASP.NET Core and is designed to be fully composable, extensible, and model-agnostic. The system supports layered response handling, allowing NPCs to detect psychological distress, modulate behavior in real-time, and gracefully re-engage when emotional stability returns. ReflexPOC is well-suited for games, therapeutic simulations, and emotionally-sensitive human-AI interactions.

# Statement of Need

Most current open-source LLM-powered agents or NPC frameworks focus on persona memory, scripted responses, or linear prompt chaining. These systems lack structured emotional resilience, real-time crisis adaptation, and internal override logic. This leads to brittle or unsafe behavior in emotionally charged interactions.

ReflexPOC addresses this need by implementing reflex-driven arbitration layers that intercept, modulate, and condition generative model responses. It provides a reusable architecture for researchers and developers who require emotionally-grounded co-agents that can respond meaningfully under psychological duress or socially complex states.

# Installation

Clone the repository and run:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

Requirements:
- .NET 8+ SDK
- (Optional) OpenAI API Key if using real-time model inference

# Usage

Upon execution, ReflexPOC prompts the user to select a personality archetype and input simulated player dialogue. Internally, the system activates reflex layers depending on stress levels, emotional cues, or contextual anomalies. Reflex outputs are merged with model-generated responses or support routines.

Example session:

```
> Select personality: 2 (Empathetic)
> Player: "I feel like everything's falling apart."
> NPC: "That sounds really difficult... I'm here with you. You're not alone in this."
```
